    Addition of xml parser for functions:
    
    	  From XML write : type="function" in the variable xml tag.
    		Also the variable (name = "xxx") needs to exist. If you want
    		to add a new variable, add it first with its main type and then
    		add the function.

    Put back the PhysicsCard fix from Kbat.
    
      It was deleted in the grat big Vec3D bug hunt over the weekend
      [23March] as I regressed back  versions to find out what I had done to
      break trackline and I didn't correctly merge forward.
      -- Now checking other items that I may well have missed.

    Major BUG fix : Error with geometry tracking:
    
       This is a major fix to the method of tracking "neutrons" through the
       simulation. The function trackCell has been re-written to use only
       isDirectionValid rather than pairValid.
    
       For the time being pairValid and all the accompaning bagage has been
       left BUT that hopefully isnt for long.
    
       The new code is much faster. It seems robust relative to simple
       checks on pipeline code [ts1 target/ess/chipIR] but could easily have
       a few problems.
    
       Further : There was an error with EllipticCyl that allowed neutrons
       to escape. [Fixed Line::intersect and EllipticCyl::setSurface]
    
       Additionally, to make life easier when intersecting projected
       objects, two additional functions have been added to Vec3D. They are
       cutComponent and Component. The functions calculate the Vec3D that is
       in the direction of the test vector. This work means that a complete
       rebuild is necessary.
    
       Additional work on exploring the TS1 upgrade has taken place.

    Coverity fix part 1:
       -- Have a coverity scan of CombLayer, it has produced one serious but
          in makeCNF [not fixed yet].
       -- a number of little annoyances and missed a couple of
    things I think it REALLY should have got but in looking in the vacinity I found.
    
    This patch's main feature is in HeadRule.getSurfaceNumbers().  The error was
    within the creation of the surface number and it could not see the second number
    regardless of the addition because I typed:
    
    SP=dynamic_cast<const SurfPoint*>(HeadNode)
    
    and it should have been headPtr not HeadNode!!
    
    That error was repeated in two other places [less common : getSurfaces()
    and getOppositeSurfaces [should now not be called].

    Bridge rule : These are surfaces or rules that do not change under

    LayerComp now tracks the number of layers. This involves a change to the

    SupplyPipe [ess model] has been improved and made slightly more
    relistic.

    Update with two new models Muon and SNS combined.
     -- The muon model is a complex muon beamline model done by Goran Skoro
     -- The SNS model is just the proto-shell to start building the SNS
     model. Not actually enough to be called a model really.
    
     Additionally, removal of removeDeadCell and AlterSurfBase as they are
     not used.

    Muon beamline working -- errors in merge from previous version fixed.
    
    Despite Goran provided me we a working verion, the previous version has
    a mis-merge error. The new string-materials system now works and the linkage within
    the getMk also has been fixed.

    Muon beamline added to the master -- branch point for SNS/Muons
    
    The muon beamlines model for TS1 has been added.
    The start but virtually no code/construction has been done for
    the SNS model.
    
    Sources have been updated a bit to allow the TS1 proton beam to be
    modeled at an position down the EPB.

    Material as a string
    
    This is a big change to almost all the build files to deal with
    materials as a string, instead of a number. That needs two things, first
    that I have added MaterialSupport.h and MaterialSupport.cxx, that give a
    complementary function EvalMat which is similar to EvalVar.
    
    Second every use of EvalVar<int> to get a material or similar needed to
    be changed.
    
    Note I have not actually started putting many of the materials in as
    names. [Just a couple in ess and ts1 to test.]

      Addition of MaterialSupport to create a EvalMat template
    
        -- this can be added to almost any file that previously used
           control.EvalVar<int> to get a material number, and now it can
           get either a name or a number.

      CylFluxTrap is empty, and a cylindrical flux trap can be achieve

    Initial modification to move materials from a number to a string
    
    The idea is that materials should be referenced by name and not
    by number. The initial version of this code needs to do two thinks:
    
    - first it needs to allow variables that are strings
    - second it needs to support named materials within the DBMaterials
    date base.
    
    The version of the code seems to do both of those jobs.

    This commit is to improve the way that PipeLines connect to objects.
    
    Previously, we had pipelines connects using points and then creating a
    surface bound on that point and using the normal that is based on the
    dividing direction of the two pipes, or for an end point used that
    segment normal.
    
    This addition adds the possibility to add a surface boundary as the pipe
    segment divider. The boundary allows curved surfaces etc to be attached.
    This is done with the function:
    
    PipeLine::addSurfPoint(Point[Vec3D],SurfaceString,CommontString)
    
    The point (mid point) is still required to construct the axis. If a
    number of pipe units link along with surfaces then it is ignored.
    The SurfaceString is the link surface pointing OUTWARD. The CommonString
    is the surface that all using of the SurfaceString obey.
    
    As a pipe is a linked line of units, the surface has to be complemented
    to get the next section. This also caused a problem becasue divider
    surface (e.g. a cylinder and a divider plane) do not need to be
    complemented. That was dealt with by adding a common surface string to
    the new function, this is not complemented.
    
    The example of this use is in the ESS model, in SupplyPipe. A lower pipe
    is connected to the lower moderator using the cylindrical surfaces.
    
    In order to make the access to the common surface easier, an additional
    funciton getCommonSurf was added to LayerComp.
